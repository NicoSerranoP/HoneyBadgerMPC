# HoneyBadgerMPC Applications
This directory contains experimental applications using HoneyBadgerMPC, some
tutorials and an experimental SDK to develop applications that integrate with
Ethereum.

**Contents**
* [`asynchromix`](asynchromix/): A message mixing application coordinated by a
  Solidity Ethereum contract.
* [`asynchromix2`](asynchromix2/): The original asynchromix application
  revisited and implemented with the experimental SDK, dockerized, and with a
  Vyper-based smart contract.
* [`auctions`](auctions/): A volume matching prototype, which is in the
  process of being integrated into an application with Ethereum.
* [`robohash`](robohash/): ERC721 NFT-based MPC-secured CryptoDNA powered
  RoboHash Factory.
* [`sdk`](sdk/): An experimental toolkit to support the development of
  applications which use Ethereum to orchestrate the multiparty computations.
* [`tutorials`](tutorial/): Examples demonstrating how one can use
  HoneyBadgerMPC to develop applications.
