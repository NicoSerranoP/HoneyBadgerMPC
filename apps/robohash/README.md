# ERC721 NFT-based MPC-secured CryptoDNA powered RoboHash
RoboHash Factory to generate robots equipped with secret DNA (aka CryptoDNA
aka private/secret genome).

The creation of RoboHashes and their secret CryptoDNA is coordinated and
secured by an EthBadgerMPC network, in which Ethereum acts as a coordinator
meanwhile HoneyBadgerMPC secures the secret CryptoDNA material, used to create
RoboHashes.

Contracts are written in Ratel, a Vyper-based language that allows writing MPC
programs.


Each secret CryptoDNA of a new RoboHash is selected from the finest Galois
Fields that mathematics has to offer.
