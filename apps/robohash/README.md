# ERC721 NFT-based MPC-secured CryptoDNA powered RoboHash
RoboHash Factory to generate robots equipped with secret DNA (aka CryptoDNA
aka private/secret genome).

The creation of RoboHashes and their secret CryptoDNA is coordinated and
secured by an EthBadgerMPC network, in which Ethereum acts as a coordinator
meanwhile HoneyBadgerMPC secures the secret CryptoDNA material, used to create
RoboHashes.

**Vyper-based, Ratel contract**
Contracts are written in Ratel, a Vyper-based language that allows writing MPC
programs.

**Galois Field -based Secret CryptoDNA**
Each secret CryptoDNA of a new RoboHash is randomly selected from the finest
Galois Fields that mathematics has to offer.

## Try it!

```shell
$ git clone --single-branch --branch robohash-ic3-bcc20 git@github.com:initc3/HoneyBadgerMPC.git

$ cd apps/robohash
$ make run
```
